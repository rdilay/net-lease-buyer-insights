## üìÇ About the Dataset

This project is based on a commercial real estate transaction dataset covering net lease property acquisitions in the United States from 2000 to 2022. It includes over 6,000 transactions and provides rich buyer-side details such as:
  - Buyer company types (Private, Institutional, Public, etc.)
  - Sale dates, sale prices, and actual cap rates
  - Geographic data including property city and state

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

Buyer-specific identifiers such as company names, contact names, phone numbers, and addresses have been replaced with fictional placeholders for privacy. All other details ‚Äî including acquisition dates, pricing, cap rates, and buyer type ‚Äî reflect real-world market data and trends.

This dataset enables deep analysis of buyer behavior, purchase frequency, market activity, and geographic trends across two decades of net lease transactions.

- Total Acquisitions
- Average Acquisitions per Year
- Average Time Between Purchases (months)
- Average Sale Price
- Average Actual Cap Rate

### Key Dimensions

## üß† Summary of Insights

-   Private buyers dominate the market with 3,125 unique companies, followed by Public (1,009) and Institutional (778) buyers. This confirms the private sector‚Äôs broad presence in net lease transactions.

- Buyer activity in the last five years (2018‚Äì2022) shows consistent momentum from Private and Public buyers, with notable surges:
  - 2021 saw the highest activity overall, with Private (546) and Public (443) buyers accelerating acquisitions.
  - In contrast, Private Equity and Institutional activity fluctuated more sharply, suggesting opportunistic rather than sustained engagement.

- Average time between acquisitions reveals how frequently different buyer types return to the market:
  - Private buyers return every ~19.6 months on average.
  - Public and Private Equity buyers are more active, acquiring every ~13 to 16 months.

- From 2010 to 2022, average sale prices rose from $1.34M to $2.35M, while cap rates dropped from 8.29% to 5.55%.
  - This trend suggests rising asset valuations and tightening yields, especially post-2014 ‚Äî important for understanding investor sentiment and pricing shifts.

- Top acquisition cities include both major metros and high-growth secondary markets:
  - Leading the list are Houston (72), Chicago (56), and Charlotte (42), indicating geographic clustering of investor interest.

## üéØ Why This Matters to the Client

This analysis helps real estate professionals and acquisition teams cut through the noise by spotlighting the buyers who are consistently active, fast-moving, and strategically positioned in the net lease market.

With these insights, the client can:
- Focus outreach on buyers with a proven pattern of repeat acquisitions
- Time conversations and deals based on average purchase frequency per buyer type
- Understand macro trends like rising valuations and tightening cap rates
- Target key markets where acquisition activity is strongest
- Prioritize private buyers with multiple acquisitions since 2018 for lead generation or partnerships

In short, this project turns raw acquisition data into clear visibility on who's buying, how often, and where ‚Äî empowering smarter strategy, prospecting, and deal execution.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations & Next Steps

Based on the insights gathered, here are actionable recommendations and opportunities for deeper analysis:

### 1. Target Repeat Private Buyers

- Focus marketing, outreach, or deal flow conversations on private buyers with 2+ acquisitions since 2018.
- These buyers have demonstrated consistency and may be receptive to new opportunities ‚Äî especially if you approach them with tailored insights.

### 2. Establish Buyer Timing Cadences

- Use the average months between acquisitions to time your follow-ups more strategically.
- For example, Private Equity and Public buyers are more active ‚Äî consider reaching out within a 12‚Äì15 month window.

### 3. Monitor Cap Rate Compression

- The downward trend in cap rates from 2010 to 2022 suggests tighter returns. Keep an eye on whether this continues in the next cycle.
- Clients involved in acquisitions or development should benchmark current deals against historical trends shown in the dashboard.

### 4. Focus Expansion in High-Volume Cities

- Cities like Houston, Chicago, and Charlotte consistently show high activity.
- These may offer better buyer density for in-person networking, faster deal cycles, or market familiarity.

### 5. Layer in Property Attributes (Future Enhancement)

- The current analysis is buyer-focused. Future analysis could include:
  - Property type (QSR, retail, industrial, etc.)
  - Tenant information
  - Lease length

- This would allow you to identify what types of properties top buyers prefer, and spot shifts in portfolio strategy.
