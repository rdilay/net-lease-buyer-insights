# 🏢 Net Lease Buyer Insights Dashboard (2000–2022)

A strategic dashboard built to help real estate professionals, investment teams, and acquisition analysts identify the most active buyers in the net lease market...

Uncovering who's buying, how often, where, and at what price point.

## 📂 About the Dataset

This project is based on a commercial real estate transaction dataset covering net lease property acquisitions in the United States from 2000 to 2022. It includes over 6,000 transactions and provides rich buyer-side details such as:
  - Buyer company types (Private, Institutional, Public, etc.)
  - Sale dates, sale prices, and actual cap rates
  - Geographic data including property city and state

⚠️ Note:

Buyer-specific identifiers such as company names, contact names, phone numbers, and addresses have been replaced with fictional placeholders for privacy. All other details — including acquisition dates, pricing, cap rates, and buyer type — reflect real-world market data and trends.

This dataset enables deep analysis of buyer behavior, purchase frequency, market activity, and geographic trends across two decades of net lease transactions.
