## 📂 About the Dataset

This project is based on a commercial real estate transaction dataset covering net lease property acquisitions in the United States from 2000 to 2022. It includes over 6,000 transactions and provides rich buyer-side details such as:
  - Buyer company types (Private, Institutional, Public, etc.)
  - Sale dates, sale prices, and actual cap rates
  - Geographic data including property city and state

⚠️ Note:

Buyer-specific identifiers such as company names, contact names, phone numbers, and addresses have been replaced with fictional placeholders for privacy. All other details — including acquisition dates, pricing, cap rates, and buyer type — reflect real-world market data and trends.

This dataset enables deep analysis of buyer behavior, purchase frequency, market activity, and geographic trends across two decades of net lease transactions.
